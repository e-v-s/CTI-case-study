# 3 Objectives

The main goal of this report is to leverage Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tools to highlight phishing indicators by analyzing the email’s design and reviewing the reports generated by:

- VirusTotal  
- Hybrid-Analysis  
- MITRE ATT&CK  
- URLScan.io  
- BurpSuite  

Based on those findings, we’ll outline mitigation strategies for the issues identified in the email, such as:

- Checking domain records  
- Updating the SPF record  
- Implementing DKIM  
- Enforcing a DMARC policy  
- Continuously monitoring the mail server  

Additionally, this document can serve as a repeatable procedure for any future phishing analyses the company might need to perform.
