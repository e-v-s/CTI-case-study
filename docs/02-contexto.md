# 2 Context

**M Solutions** (a placeholder name for confidentiality) is an automation and control company specializing in programming and commissioning ICS/SCADA systems. For the past ten years, they’ve used their own domain and an associated email provider. They’d never faced a phishing attempt, until now.

In March 2025, the company received a suspicious email that bore all the hallmarks of phishing. It was sent to the CEO, slipped past the provider’s spam filters, claiming that multiple login attempts had been detected.

Then, on June 1st, 2025, another email landed, this time warning that his account was about to be deactivated unless he clicked a link to verify it. The message came from the CEO’s very own email domain.
